#Here's an inverter
DEFINE Inverter inv_input	inv_output  #Use tabs spaces or (a,b) for formatting
	BUILD !inv_input => inv_output 		# & | ! == != are inbuild.

#As are AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and XNOR, but for the sake of the exercise lets pretend they're not.

Everything after "BUILD" is, well, built. Literally. The power of FPGAs is that when inv_input changes, inv_output changes within nanoseconds, if not faster.

DEFINE Nand 		in_1, in2		out #Capitalize block names, lowercase for nodes
	BUILD
		Inverter temp_1 temp_2 #Builds an inverter between temp_1 and temp_2
		in_1 => temp_1 #Connects in_1 to temp_1
		temp_2 => out_1

		#You can also do this directly with
		Inverter in_2 out_2

		out <= out_1&out_2	#Paths can be =>, <= or <> for bidirectional.
							#Note that bidirectional paths are faster, but you 
							#have to be more careful with them
END


#To actually load this into an {NAME}, use

a <= PortA[0]
b <= PortA[1]
c => PortA[2]
Nand(a,b,c) #This formatting also works

#As far as actually loading this... HAHAHAHAHA!
